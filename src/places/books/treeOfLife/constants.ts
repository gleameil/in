I could attempt to enumerate the High Heavens I have known, if I have known any, but I fear these accounts should be laughablly vague — or, as with much philosophy and theology, so scourging to the heart there is no way to desire it. Besides, the rest of my writing aims for the High Heavens indirectly, the modes of knowing just short of disappearance into the divine.
