export const BOOKS_INTRO = `Hi, visitor!
As I may have already said, help yourself to this pile.
Look at whatever you want.
I keep a lot of stuff. Probably too much.
The funny part is that it's not going to be the same stuff every time you look.
If you don't see what you're expecting, I may not have written it yet...
...or you may not have the eyes to see it yet.
The more both of us explore, the more you'll find here.
♥,
Jennie`
